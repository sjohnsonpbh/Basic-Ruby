Exercise 1.5: Printing user data
Create a Ruby file called exercise-1.5.rb.

Given the array of hashes:

users = [
    {
        name: "John Doe",
        age: 43
    },
    {
        name: "Amy Singer",
        age: 53
    },
    {
        name: "Jimmy Lendricks",
        age: 23
    }
]
Use a while loop to print the values of each hash such as "My name is ... and I am ...". If the first name starts with "Jimmy", print out "My name and age is confidential."

expected output:

> My name is John Doe and I am 43.
> My name is Amy Singer and I am 54.
> My name and age is confidential.
