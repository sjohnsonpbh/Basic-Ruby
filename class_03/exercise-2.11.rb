# Exercise 2.11: Animal class
# Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.11.rb.

# Define a class called Animal and set attributes name, animal_type and color using the method attr_accessors (keep in mind, attributes refer to instance variables).
# Initialize an Animal instance and store it in a variable called dog.
# Access attributes name in dog and set it to "Clifford". Fill in the rest of the attributes.
# Print out each attribute dog contains.
# Create an instance method called intro. When you call intro, it should print Hey, my name is Clifford. I'm red and I am a dog to the console. Use string interpolation to do this.
# Output

# > Hey, my name is Clifford.
# > I am a dog.
# > My fur color is red.

    def initialize(name)
        @name = name

    def type
        @color = color
    end

dog = Animal.new("dog")

puts "Hey, my name is #{@name}."
